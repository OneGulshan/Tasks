Note:- [.. _context.Menus] and _context.Menus.AsNoTracking().ToList(); <- is the same it's a collection expression/use expression body for method.

AsNoTracking <- AsNoTracking() Method used to Improving Performace in App. EF tracks the changes
by default. This tracking entities comes with some overhead, when you retriving data read only
purpose, such as displaying it in a list or report. Also use when retriving large amount data,
such as when exporting data to a file then we used this method in our project.
Ex. var data = _context.Questions.AsNoTracking().ToList();

what is the benefit of using expression body in C#?
The expression-bodied syntax can be used when a member's body consists only of one expression.
It uses the =>(fat arrow) operator to define the body of the method or property and allows getting
rid(छुटकारा दिलाना) of curly braces and the return keyword.
ex. public void CityDelete(City city) => _dataContext.Cities.Remove(city); <- alternative of:-
public void CityDelete(City city)
{
    _dataContext.Cities.Remove(city);
}

Why do we use private readonly in C#?
If it's private and readonly , the benefit is that you can't inadvertently change it from another
part of that class after it is initialized. The readonly modifier ensures the field can only be
given a value during its initialization or in its class constructor.

FileHandling Task

- HttpPostedFileBase has been removed from asp.net core and introduce a new interface
IFormFile for uploading Files in Asp.Net Core 2.0 and 3.0, IFormFile can receive any type of
files.
- When We Scaffolding with DataContext its means we work with DataContext on this View Simple.
- enctype="multipart/form-data" <- for indicate in our form using a file upload control.
- name prop of html input for sending data to db.
- ContentLength Prop Return data in bytes because its a long property simple.
- File.Exists Method Check the Specified file.

If the machine you want to pull from is accessible via ssh, you can add the repository on it
as a remote via ssh, and then pull from it like you would any remote:

$ git remote add repo_b username@host:path/to/repository.git
$ git pull repo_b master
(You can skip the step of adding a remote and just specify the full URL in the git pull
command instead of a remote name, but if you're going to be pulling from the repository on a
regular basis, adding it as a remote will save you lots of typing.)

Events Scheduler calendar Task

- &times; <- this is a unicode character in C# and &times; is for X(close) simble

jQuery DataTable using offline(on Question Controller)
-------------------------------------------------------
- https://datatables.net/download/ -> Download -> Download files -> extract file -> move in js folder -> copy jquery-dataTables & min file -> create DataTable folder in root and past in it.
- In js folder create a datatable_file.js file and link this file in Index View in @section scripts.
- Now link dataTables.js then dataTables.min.js file in Layout & dataTables.css & dataTables.min.css also.
- Now in datatable_file.js write Bind DataTable code on Index.
Note:- Large Amount data can't be handeled by DataTable but we can handle small amount of data using by Take(50) method. For Solving this we maked a seprate method and return data in Json Format,
then remove IEnumerable and display using datatable_file.js file in Table.
